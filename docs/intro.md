title: SUSE HackWeek Nov 2023 - Diagramming for Docs
---

My proposal for hack week is to dive into diagramming for the doc(s) team(s) as I've struggled to give it the decent block of time it needs. Thoughts, pointers, links welcome.

There are a few iterative parts:

* Refine and expand the requirements
* Select a few tools, one or two diagrams-as-code tools, one or two more interactive tools
* Do some work with them, produce my two current requirement diagrams, consider the trials and tribulations.
* Make the recommendations for moving forwards, a report, as a small Docusaurus site.

The requirements, at present:

* Text based format for diagram files. At a minimum SVG or XML.
* Usable on Linux, Mac, Win, or via the web
* Open Source project compatible. So leaning away from, say LucidChart, and towards, say, Mermaid.js
* Standards, not much out there, maybe C4 architecture diagramming, or UML
* Simplicity is best, we don't have many diagrams. But extensibility to consider.
* Consider merits of Diagram-as-Code vs Interactive editors (for our current, and perhaps future use cases)
